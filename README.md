# NVIDIA SDK ORCHESTRATOR

> An interactive graph that maps NVIDIA's entire AI product stack — describe your goal in plain English and Groq AI generates the exact step-by-step path through the ecosystem. (New system updates underway)

## What It Does

Developers approaching NVIDIA's AI stack face a fragmented landscape — NIM, NeMo, Triton, TensorRT, Brev — with no map showing how they relate or where to start.

This tool solves that by:

- Visualising all **25 official NVIDIA AI services** as an interactive hexagonal graph
- Drawing **documented connection edges** between services (no invented relationships)
- Letting you describe any goal in plain English — **LlaMa 3.3 Nemotron super 49b v1 AI maps the right services in the correct layer order**
- Highlighting your path on the graph with **animated edges + step-by-step guidance**
- **Explore mode** — click any node to see its official description and docs in the sidebar

## Features

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| **AI Path Generator** | Type any AI goal — Groq (`llama-3.3-70b`) returns the correct NVIDIA service path with roles and actions per step |
| **Strict layer ordering** | Paths always flow `Access → SDK → Frameworks → Agentic AI → Serving → Enterprise` |
| **Cannot-verify fallback** | If no documented path exists, the AI declines and suggests relevant services instead of fabricating an answer |
| **Interactive hex graph** | Pan, zoom, click — full React Flow canvas with `smoothstep` connection arrows |
| **Game HUD tooltips** | Hover any node for a scanline-style panel with description, tags, and official docs link |
| **Layer zoom** | Hover a layer column header to zoom the canvas into that layer's services |
| **Explore mode** | Browse every service freely — click a node to load its full description and connections in the sidebar |
| **Workflow step navigator** | Follow AI-generated paths step-by-step with auto-pan to each active node and a progress bar |
| **Glassmorphism UI** | Hex nodes with blur + NVIDIA green glow on hover/active states, pitch-black canvas |
| **Responsive** | Hamburger sidebar on mobile, abbreviated layer labels at tablet widths |

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- A [Groq API key](https://console.groq.com/keys) — free tier is sufficient

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Doondi-Ashlesh/nvidia-ecosystem-visualizer.git
cd nvidia-ecosystem-visualizer
npm install
```

### Environment

Create `.env.local` in the project root:

```env
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
```

### Run

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Deploy to Vercel

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https://github.com/Doondi-Ashlesh/nvidia-ecosystem-visualizer&env=GROQ_API_KEY&envDescription=Groq%20API%20key%20for%20AI%20path%20generation&envLink=https://console.groq.com/keys)

1. Click the button above or import the repo at [vercel.com/new](https://vercel.com/new)
2. Add the environment variable: `GROQ_API_KEY` = your Groq API key
3. Deploy — Vercel auto-detects Next.js

## How the AI Path Generation Works

The Groq prompt enforces strict rules before returning any path:

1. **Layer ordering** — steps must flow `access → sdk → framework → agent → serving → enterprise`
2. **Documented connections only** — only officially-documented service relationships are used
3. **Self-verification** — the model checks layer order, connection validity, and docs grounding before responding
4. **Cannot-verify fallback** — unrecognised goals return a structured response listing suggested services to investigate, never a fabricated path
